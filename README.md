# java-design-patterns
This repo is to track and practice my learnings about Java Design Pattern

## CHAPTER 1: Structural Design Patters
Structural Design patterns are of 2 types: Class Patterns and Object Patterns

### Structural Class Patterns
These are about how classes are structured and interact with each other.
There is a focus on inheritance
Several of these patterns make use of interfaces to define shared functionality.

### Structural Object Patterns
These are about how to use objects.
How to manage objects at runtime.
